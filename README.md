# reactive-state


## Motivation 
    I this project I want to learn about reactivity in general


## Why I did this project 
    Worked on some projects I worked with a huge number of programmers
    From junior -> tech leads and I saw what big mistakes they make. 
    I want to try to see how hard it is to think reactive

    IMHO it is not. But I got a book and I'm going through it.

## What problem does it solve?
